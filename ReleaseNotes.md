### Update Notes

#### Support for JSON Card Data in card-terminal-client

This change allows the use of card data in JSON format within the card-terminal-client component instead only the
premade XML card images.

## Release 2.2.0

### Update Notes

#### Upgrade to ZETA 0.5.x (PoPP)

When upgrading your installation you might encounter issues with a database
migration in the PoPP stack. To fix the issue, delete the ZETA *PoPP* PDP
database volume:

1. Ensure the relevant containers are stopped
2. Delete the volume `testhub-local_popp-zeta-postgres-db-data`, e.g.:
    ```
    docker volume rm testhub-local_popp-zeta-postgres-db-data
    ```

#### JWKS Endpoint compatibility

The popp-sample-implementation currently only supports the legacy `/jwks.json`
endpoint. If you haven't changed the default PoPP stack configuration, then
popp-sample-implementation and popp-token-generator use the same key material
and popp-token-generator can be used for the `pep_popp_issuer` setting.

See *Known Issues* in the user manual.

#### ASL for VSDM

This release enables ASL for the communication of the VSDM components. The
behavior is activated by default to follow the VSDM specification. Tiger does
automatically decrypt the traffic when running E2E tests for VSDM. Visit [the
Testhub user manual](https://gematik.github.io/ti2.0-testhub/) to learn how to
disable ASL.

### Changes

- TESTHUB-26: Enable ASL by default for VSDM ZETA.
- TESTHUB-96: Update popp-client/popp-server dependencies to use latest version of Zeta (0.5.x).
- TESTHUB-107: add traffic protocol for E2E tests
- TESTHUB-111: remove zeta-client-lib. The library is no longer needed as all
  mocked Zeta components have been removed.
- TESTHUB-115: Update Tiger to version 4.2.6. See [Tiger Release
  Notes](https://github.com/gematik/app-Tiger/blob/e3aef5b012a9f65894b19b3b1448837bb98b3a21/ReleaseNotes.md#release-426)
  for more information.
- TESTHUB-116: refactor handling of attached card and PoPP token (contributed by
  [@prat023](https://github.com/prat023))
- ZTI-4187: Add policy hot-reload test verifying that OPA applies policy changes at runtime without restart.

## Release 2.1.0

### Update Notes

#### Upgrade to ZETA 0.5.x (VSDM)

The ZETA Guard PEP validates PoPP tokens. In order to validate the token's
signature a public keys is required. The public key is published by the PoPP
issuer. With 0.5.1 changes have been made to how the public key is retrieved. If
you are using a custom PoPP implementation you will have to ensure that you
support the new flow. Refer to the [relevant code in the PEP for more
information](https://github.com/gematik/zeta-guard-ngx-pep/blob/22888ebecf9019d2102503a8e0761e32f37e12d2/src/jwk_cache.rs#L205).

If you are changing the keys in the PoPP sample implementation you will have to
update the key for the PoPP Token Generator. In order for the new public key to
work with Testhub components we are using the PoPP Token Generator as PoPP
issuer until the sample implementation can catch up.

Refer to the projects release notes to find out what changed:

- https://github.com/gematik/zeta-guard-ngx-pep/blob/main/ReleaseNotes.md
- https://github.com/gematik/zeta-sdk/blob/main/ReleaseNotes.md

### Changes

- TESTHUB-85: validate all required fields of the UserInfo header. The required fields are defined
  in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gematik/zeta/refs/heads/main/src/schemas/zeta-user-info.yaml
- TESTHUB-98: add mock-popp profile which starts only the components required for the PoPP token generator.
- TESTHUB-101: simplify switching between PoppTokenGenerator and PoppExampleImplementation components.
- TESTHUB-103: Update VSDM ZETA components to 0.5.x
- TESTHUB-105: refer to user manual for information about profiles
- ZTI-4056: add SMC-B token exchange tests for ZETA client

## Release 2.0.0

This release includes the integration of the Popp Sample Implementation into the
TestHub. The Popp Sample Implementation is an implementation of a Proof of
Possession (PoPP) token generator, which can be used for testing and development
purposes. It provides a simple way to generate PoPP tokens that can be used in
the TestHub for various test scenarios.

Through configuration the PoPP tokens can also be generated by the
PoppTokenGenerator as before. Please refer to the user manual(chapter 6) for
more details on how to use the Popp Example Implementation and how to configure
the TestHub to use it for PoPP token generation.

### Known issues

The ngx_pep (ZETA PEP, version 0.3.0) rejects WebSocket upgrade requests with
HTTP 403 even when the Access Token and DPoP proof are valid. Regular REST
requests with the same credentials work correctly (HTTP 200). The WebSocket
integration test (`popp_websocket_via_pep.feature`) is therefore marked as
`@Ignore` until the issue is resolved in a future ngx_pep release.

It is possible that PoPP token generation will lead to timeouts on systems with
high load. We are aware and are going to investigate possible solutions.

PoPP token generation with external services is not yet supported in this version.

Gatling performance tests currently have limited utility due to poor performance
of PoPP token generation.

### Changes

- LART-1474: add [popp example
  implementation](https://github.com/gematik/popp-sample-code). Uses an older
  ZETA version.
- TESTHUB-53: Replace license plugin by license-maven-plugin
- ZTI-4099: Added TLS Guard conformance tests to ZETA Testsuite (BSI TR-02102-2)
- ZTI-4375: migrate ZETA testsuite from mock services to Docker-based
  ngx_pep + Keycloak PDP. Token creation now uses real OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange
  with SMC-B authentication and DPoP binding. Updated tests for REST data
  transfer, header management, client registration and WebSocket communication.

## Release 1.1.15

### Update Notes

#### Upgrade to ZETA 0.4.x

When upgrading your installation you will encounter issues with a database
migration. To fix the issue, delete the ZETA PDP database volume:

1. Ensure the relevant containers are stopped
2. Delete the volume `testhub-local_postgres_data`, e.g.:
    ```
    docker volume rm testhub-local_postgres_data 
    ```

Refer to the projects release notes to find out what changed:

  `ReleaseNotes.md`

## Release 1.1.14

### Update Notes

#### Docker Compose Profiles (TESTHUB-64)

Docker Compose now supports profiles for different startup configurations:

- `full`: Full stack with Tiger-Proxies and clients
- `perf`: Performance mode - clients connect directly to backend, bypassing Tiger-Proxy
- `backend-only`: Backend services only, no Tiger-Proxies or clients

Example usage:

```bash
docker compose -f doc/docker/compose-local.yaml --profile full up -d          # full stack 
docker compose -f doc/docker/compose-local.yaml --profile perf up -d          # performance testing
docker compose -f doc/docker/compose-local.yaml --profile backend-only up -d  # backend only
```

### Changes

- TESTHUB-64: Add Docker Compose profiles for performance testing (`full`, `perf`, `backend-only`)
- TESTHUB-64: Reintroduce Tiger-Proxy into the communication between client and server
- TESTHUB-62: Add additional troubleshooting tips to the user manual.
- TESTHUB-81: Allow application/fhir+xml content type

## Release 1.1.11

### Changes

- TESTHUB-76: remove empty script files from `doc/bin` and improve documentation
  with troubleshooting tips.
- ZTI-4057: Initial client registration in zeta-testsuite: Service Discovery (well-known) and Dynamic Client
  Registration (POST /register)
- ZTI-4057: New `/register` mock endpoint in zeta-pdp-server-mockservice with RFC 7591 input validation and error
  response

## Release 1.1.10

### Update Notes

#### Obsolete SMCB Files (TESTHUB-54)

The content of the following files has been moved to environment variables and the files can be removed:

- doc/docker/backend/zeta/smcb-private/smcb_private.alias.txt
- doc/docker/backend/zeta/smcb-private/smcb_private.pw.txt

#### Removed Bash Script Files (TESTHUB-55)

The Bash script files in `doc/bin/` have been removed. Use regular commands as documented in the `README.md`.
For example:

- `docker-compose-local-restart.sh` can be replaced with
  ```bash
  docker compose -f ./doc/docker/compose-local.yaml down -v
  docker compose -f ./doc/docker/compose-local.yaml --profile full up -d --remove-orphans
  ```
- `test-with-compose-local-rebuild.sh` can be replaced with
  ```bash
  ./mvnw clean install -Pdocker -DskipTests
  docker compose -f ./doc/docker/compose-local.yaml down -v
  docker compose -f ./doc/docker/compose-local.yaml --profile full up -d --remove-orphans
  ./mvnw -pl test/vsdm-testsuite/ -Dit.test="Vsdm*IT" -Dskip.inttests=false verify
