# TI 2.0 Testhub

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is intended for testing and development purposes only.

An environment to develop and test applications for the German Telematics
Infrastructure 2.0 (TI 2.0).

- Run core TI 2.0 services protected by ZETA Guard locally
- Utilize E2E tests written to validate your custom service(VSDM, PoPP)
- Verify your custom ZETA Client can work with the official ZETA Guard
- Connect your application to a mock TI 2.0

# Getting Started

## Acquire SMC-B Certificate

ZETA requires an SMC-B certificate to work. Follow these steps:

1. Request a test SMC-B certificate
   from [gematik Anfrageportal](https://service.gematik.de/servicedesk/customer/portal/37/create/198)
   You will receive the certificate from Gematik as a ZIP file.
2. In the ZIP file locate a `.p12` file whose filename includes `AUT_E256_`.
3. Extract the file and rename it to `smcb_private.p12`
4. Place the file in the `doc/docker/backend/zeta/smcb-private` folder

## Install Required Software

- Java 21
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Optional: A GUI for Docker (e.g. Docker Desktop) can be helpful for monitoring containers and viewing logs.
  We had good results with [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/), which is a free and open source alternative to
  Docker Desktop.

## Start Docker Containers

1. Build required Docker images locally:
   ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install -Pdocker -DskipTests
    ```
2. Remove Docker containers from previous runs:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./doc/docker/compose-local.yaml --profile full down -v
    ```
3. Start Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./doc/docker/compose-local.yaml --profile full up -d --remove-orphans
    ```

### Port Configuration

Host ports are defined in [`doc/docker/.env`](./doc/docker/.env).
Docker Compose loads this file automatically. You can customize these to fit your environment. For more information
refer to the
[user manual configuration section](https://gematik.github.io/ti2.0-testhub/#_port_configuration_via_env_file).

```bash
# Example: remap VSDM server from 9130 to 19130
PORT_VSDM_SERVER=19130 docker compose -f ./doc/docker/compose-local.yaml --profile full up -d
```

A full list of available port variables and their defaults is documented in the
[user manual configuration section](https://gematik.github.io/ti2.0-testhub/#_port_configuration_via_env_file).

To learn about additional scenarios and available `docker compose` profiles refer to
the [Docker Compose Profiles section in the user manual](https://gematik.github.io/ti2.0-testhub/#_docker_compose_profiles).

# Usage

## Running Tests

To verify Testhub is working as expected run the VSDM2 integration tests:

```bash
./mvnw -pl test/vsdm-testsuite/ -Dit.test="Vsdm*IT" -Dskip.inttests=false verify
```

Additional E2E tests can be found in `test/`.

## Running Tests Manually

Tests are written using Cucumber and Gherkin. The files are located in `test/`.

To execute tests manually using IntelliJ:

1. Install the plugins Gherkin and Cucumber for Java.
2. [Configure IntelliJ using the Tiger manual](https://gematik.github.io/app-Tiger/Tiger-User-Manual.html#intellij)
3. Locate your desired test case and run it in IntelliJ

# Release Notes

See [ReleaseNotes.md](./ReleaseNotes.md) for all information regarding the (latest) releases.

# User Manual

The [Testhub user manual](https://gematik.github.io/ti2.0-testhub/) is available
online. Make sure to check [the Troubleshooting
section](https://gematik.github.io/ti2.0-testhub/#_faq_troubleshooting) if you run
into any issues.

# Getting Help

When requesting help or reporting issues please include the following information:

- What operating system are you running? Which CPU architecture? How many CPUs
  are available? How much memory does your machine have?
- Which commands are you running so that we can reproduce the issue. What is the
  outcome?
- Supply any applicable logs. You can use [docker
  logs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/logs/).
